# Enhancements for Bittrex crypto trading website
Bittrex is one of the leading trading websites for bitcoins and other cryptocurrency altcoins.
Traders love Bittrex but hate their website. Especially the charts...

### Time to enhance Bittrex
These enhancements for bittrex are userscripts that do the following:
1. Bittrex fav charts on homescreen.user.js
add two tradingview widgets on the bittrex homepage. USDT to various cryptocoins and BTC to various cryptocoins.

2. bittrex-chart-layout-save.user.js
add a save and refresh icon in the bittrex chart toolbar. Save will save current chart layout to localStorage. Drawings (via toolbar) are not saved. Only candlestick period and indicators.

3. bittrex-exchange-trading-view-chart.user.js
Swap bittrex chart with tradingview chart.

4. bittrex-usd-enhancer.user.js
add estimated USD in various bittrex tables. 

### Installation
to be used in tampermonkey browser plugin.
instructions coming soon.

### Final
These scripts probably give more joy than just another app bought in an arbritary appstore :-)
So please support my hard labour and be so kind to buy me a cup of coffee.

A Starbucks freshly brewed Grande coffee is only $1.95. That equals:
```
0.00012 BTC --> 1BWpx9MCVRfcfvJ8AWWcdWJCzE5Dqn685s
0.0025 ETH --> 0x3b305459a76c3b29d24e4667eb57f3272067d424
0.0063 LTC --> LW3Me6NSxdUPh9FsHyKh9ojRkKJWhMvBgw
(coinmarketcap prices of dec 20 2017)
```
Cheers!
