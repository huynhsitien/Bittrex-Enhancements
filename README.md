# Enhancements for Bittrex crypto trading website
Bittrex is one of the leading trading websites for bitcoins and other cryptocurrency altcoins.
Traders love Bittrex but hate their website. Especially the charts...

### Time to enhance Bittrex
These enhancements for bittrex are userscripts that do the following:

1. bittrex-chart-enhancements.user.js
    Adds the following HUGE enhancements to bittrex charts toolbar:
    * save chart settings (including studies and candleperiods, yeah!) in local storage and auto-restore on loading chart
    * save chart annotations (drawings) in local storage and auto-restore on loading chart
    * add chart reload button

2. add fullscreen chart button.user.js
    Adds a fullscreen toggle button to bittrex charts. Because we want big charts!

3. Bittrex add tradingview chart.user.js
    Adds tradingview chart widget as new tab next to the bittrex chart. So both are now available and you can flip back and forth!

3. bittrex USD Enhancer.user.js
    Adds USD conversion all over the place. This is a userscript port of the google chrome addon by Nirvana Tikku, with a few enhancements and modifications.
    Some conversion columns might not show up in tables if your browsers window is too small. This is due to bootstrap column resizing.

4. Bittrex fav charts on homescreen.user.js
    Adds two tradingView widgets on bittrex home screen (<a href="https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets" target="_blank">https://bittrex.com/Home/Markets</a>).
      * USDT to most common cryptocoins
      * BCT to most common cryptocoins

### Final
These scripts probably give more joy than just another app bought in an arbritary appstore :-)
So please support my hard labour and be so kind to buy me a cup of coffee.

A Starbucks freshly brewed Grande coffee is only $1.95. That equals:
```
0.00012 BTC --> 1BWpx9MCVRfcfvJ8AWWcdWJCzE5Dqn685s
0.0025 ETH --> 0x3b305459a76c3b29d24e4667eb57f3272067d424
0.0063 LTC --> LW3Me6NSxdUPh9FsHyKh9ojRkKJWhMvBgw
```
